# Attribute-recognition-and-reidentification-Market1501-dataset


The goal of this work is to develop a system that is able to, make predictions about some attributes of the people in the dataset and reidentify people in the test set using the queries images in the query folder. The systems is trained and evaluated on the Market-1501 dataset.
For further details, please check the report.
